# SMART criteria

I want to [describe your plan, goal, objective, task, todo, motivation, challenge, etc].

Explain how use SMART criteria:

- Specific: the plan should target one area clearly and precisely.
- Measurable: the plan should quantify progress by using metrics.
- Achievable: the plan should be able to start, able to continue, and able to accomplish.
- Relevant: the plan should be closely connected to what's happening and being considered.
- Timely: the plan should occur at a favorable time or useful time or opportune time.

Also known as SMART goal, SMART objective, SMART plan, SMART task, SMART todo.
